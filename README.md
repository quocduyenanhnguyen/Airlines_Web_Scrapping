# Software I used:
[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/): to write SQL 

[PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows): to run Python script to scrap airlines data

[Data source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_airlines_in_the_world)

# Description: 

- I scrapped airline data from a Wiki page, did some data cleaning in Google Sheet, imported the dataset to the database, did some more data cleaning, then created two views in the database and then connected Tableau to the data source to visualize.
- Attached to this repos is my Python script to scrap data, SQL queries and output of data cleaning.
